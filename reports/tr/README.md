Placeholder to store results of crawling the latest published versions of specifications (as opposed to the latest Editor's Drafts), starting from the list in [specs-all.json](https://github.com/tidoust/reffy/blob/master/src/specs/specs-all.json).

Files in this folder should not be pushed to the Reffy repository. They should
rather be pushed to [reffy-reports](https://github.com/tidoust/reffy-reports).
